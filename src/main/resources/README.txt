Run the downloadInput gradle task to download the input files automatically. Your Advent of Code session ID
must be stored in an advent.session.id property in a local.properties file at the root of the repository.

If the session ID is not configured, you must manually obtain input data for each day from the
original source at https://adventofcode.com/2022 and save it in a directory and text file named
after the corresponding year and day (2022/day01.txt, 2022/day02.txt, 2022/day03.txt, etc.).
